         within which your code runs. There are 2 types of execution context -global or function. 
         There are 2 phrase in each context-creation and executing phase. 
         As the JavaScript engine starts to read thecode, it creates Global Execution Context.
        
          lexical environment: the scope or environment the engine is currently reading code in
          a new lexical environment created using '{}'
          lexical scope: available data + variables where function was defined
          dynamic scope: where function is called 
          First variable is searched in functional scope, if not found then searched in global scope
